# Medical Entity Recognition and Knowledge Map Relationship Analysis of Chinese EMRs Based on Improved BiLSTM-CRF

## Dataset

The CCKS dataset is designed for the task of recognizing and extracting clinical entities from a given set of electronic medical record (EMR) text documents. The goal is to identify and categorize these entity mentions into predefined categories, such as diseases, treatments, and examinations.

1. **Diseases and Diagnoses:** Medically defined diseases and clinical judgments made by physicians regarding etiology, pathophysiology, classification, and staging.

2. **Examinations:** Imaging examinations (X-ray, CT, MR, PETCT, etc.), angiography, ultrasound, and electrocardiograms. To avoid overlap with surgical operations, other diagnostic procedures like gastroscopy and colonoscopy are not included.

3. **Tests:** Physical or chemical examinations conducted in a laboratory. Specifically, this refers to clinical laboratory tests conducted by the laboratory department, excluding immunohistochemistry and other broad laboratory tests.

4. **Surgeries:** Procedures involving the removal or suturing of body parts by physicians as a primary method of surgical treatment.

5. **Medications:** Specific chemical substances used for disease treatment.

6. **Anatomical Sites:** The anatomical locations in the human body where diseases, symptoms, and signs occur.

Each line of data in Task 1 is a JSON object. The JSON keys are `[originalText', 'entities']`, representing the original text and the list of entities.

The json`["entities"]` is a list where each element represents an entity. Each entity includes:

The training data has been preprossed into forms as below:

```
心	B-TESTIMAGE
脏	I-TESTIMAGE
彩	I-TESTIMAGE
超	I-TESTIMAGE
：	O
右	B-ANATOMY
房	I-ANATOMY
、	O
右	B-ANATOMY
室	I-ANATOMY
稍	O
增	O
大	O
，	O
E	B-TESTLAB
F	I-TESTLAB
正	O
常	O
。	O
```

ATTENTION:

- Use a tab character ("\t") to separate words and labels.
- Use a blank line to separate sentences.
- End the file with two newline characters.

You can run statistic.py to view information about sentence length and quantity.
